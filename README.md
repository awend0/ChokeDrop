# ChokeDrop
Simple SpigotMC plugin.


Disable keepInventory and download this plugin. After death players drop valuable resources and XP only. Valuable resources must be written in ChokeDrops.txt file line by line (ex DIAMOND, DIAMOND_ORE, DIAMOND_BLOCK, etc), that file must be in the same folder with server's core.
